communities = community.greedy_modularity_communities(graph)
final_clusters = kmeans(community_features, n_clusters=3)
```

### 2. Cross-View Feature Alignment
```python
# Advanced alignment for drone-satellite matching
aligned_global = self.alignment_layer(global_features)
aligned_locals = [self.alignment_layer(feat) for feat in local_features]
alignment_loss = mse_loss(drone_features, satellite_features)
```

### 3. Comprehensive Evaluation Pipeline
```python
# Automatic metrics calculation every epoch
metrics = {
    'accuracy': accuracy_score(y_true, y_pred),
    'auc_roc': roc_auc_score(y_true, y_prob, multi_class='ovr'),
    'precision_macro': precision_score(y_true, y_pred, average='macro'),
    'recall_macro': recall_score(y_true, y_pred, average='macro'),
